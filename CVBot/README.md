# 🧠 CVBot — CV Q&A Assistant

CVBot allows you to upload a **CV in PDF** and ask questions about it using **embeddings** and **LLMs** from **Ollama**. The interface is built with **Streamlit** and runs inside a **Docker container**.  

This setup keeps the Docker image lightweight, as the models are handled by Ollama installed on your local machine.

---

## 🚀 Prerequisites

Before running the bot, make sure you have:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download) installed on your machine

---

## 📥 Install Ollama Models

After installing Ollama, you need to download the models used by CVBot:

```bash
# Pull the LLM model
ollama pull llama3.1

# Pull the embedding model
ollama pull mxbai-embed-large
```

## 🐋 Build and Run CVBot Docker Image

1. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd path/to/CVBot
```

2. Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t cvbot .
```

3. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -p 8501:8501 cvbot
```

4. Open your browser and go to:

```bash
http://localhost:8501
```

## 📄 How to Use

1. Upload your CV in PDF format.

2. (Optional) Add manual context in the text box.

3. Ask questions about your CV and receive answers generated by the model.

4. Adjust temperature and k in the sidebar to control model creativity and number of retrieved CV sections.

## ⚙️ Notes

* Keep Ollama running on your machine while using the bot.

* The Docker image is lightweight because it **does not include the models** — they are managed by Ollama.
